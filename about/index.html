        <p id="about-paragraph">I am David Moruzzi, a junior at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Media and Information with a minor in Information Technology. Additionally, I am a Service Desk Technician for the College of Engineering. I am personally fascinated by computers and believe they are capable of some incredible things. Computers open the floodgates to so many new possibilities. When I graduate, I want to expand those possibilities and improve the world around me. I find great joy in is helping others and I want to use computers to assist me on that adventure.
